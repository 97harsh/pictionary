# Sound Files

This directory should contain optional sound effects for the Pictionary game.

## Required Files (Optional)

The app looks for these sound files but will work fine without them:

- `tick.wav` - Countdown tick sound (plays during final 10 seconds)
- `timesup.wav` - Round timeout sound
- `correct.wav` - Correct guess celebration sound

## How to Add Sounds

1. Find or create short WAV or MP3 sound files
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this `/public/sounds/` directory
4. Reload the app

## Recommendations

- **tick.wav**: Short click/tick sound (~0.1-0.2s)
- **timesup.wav**: Bell or chime sound (~0.5-1s)
- **correct.wav**: Success/celebration sound (~1-2s)

## Free Sound Resources

- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
- [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
- [BBC Sound Effects](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/)

The game will function perfectly without these files - they're purely optional enhancements!
